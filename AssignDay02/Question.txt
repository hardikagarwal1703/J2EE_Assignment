Day 21
1. import day21.1 , to revise
1.1 Problem without ITC
1.2 deadlock due to sleep
1.3 deadlock due to only wait
1.4 complete solution

2. import day21.2 , to revise
2.1 Daemon threads
2.2 Cloning
2.3 Reflection API

3. import day21.3.
Refer to "day21-data\day21_help\MYSQL Connector\readme db connectivity steps.txt"
If required , take  lab faculty's help , to ensure DB connectivity.

4. Hands on
Refer to "day20-lab-data\day20.4\src\utils\SynchroUtils.java"
Like Day 20 ,write testers(MUST use lambda expression to create threads) , to test the following

What will happen  (Set it up in the eclipse project)
4.1 If 1 thread is invoking static synchronized method(test1) n other thread is calling non static synchronized method(test) , predict the o/p . Run code n confirm o/p

4.2 Create t1 thread to call test1 method n another thread t2 to call test2.
What will happen ?

4.3 Create t1 thread to call test1 method n another thread t2 to call test3
What will happen ?
Synchronized o/p (blocking) or un synchronized o/p (async)
If it's async : synchronize it BUT w/o touching SynchroUtils class.
